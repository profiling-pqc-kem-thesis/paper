\section{On the content}
Your introduction has two main purposes: 1) to give an overview of the main points of your thesis, and 2) to awaken the reader's interest. It is recommended to rewrite the introduction one last time when the writing is done, to ensure that it connects well with your conclusion.

\emph{Tip}: For a nice, stylistic twist you can reuse a theme from the introduction in your conclusion. For example, you might present a particular scenario in one way in your introduction, and then return to it in your conclusion from a different -- richer or contrasting -- perspective.

The introduction should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The background for your choice of theme
    \item A problem statement that defines the scope of your thesis
    \item A schematic outline of the remainder of your thesis 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Background}
The background sets the general tone for your thesis. It should make a good impression and convince the reader why the theme is important and why your approach is appropriate and relevant. Even so, it should be no longer than necessary.

What is considered a relevant background depends on your field and its traditions. Background information might be historical in nature, or it might refer to previous research or practical considerations. You can also focus on a specific text, thinker or problem.

Academic writing often means having a discussion with yourself (or some imagined opponent). To open your discussion, there are several options available. You may, for example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refer to a contemporary event
    \item Outline a specific problem, a case study or an example
    \item Review the relevant research/literature to demonstrate the need for this particular type of research 
\end{itemize}

You can also define here the fundamental concepts your thesis builds on. Your thesis implements a new type of parser generator and uses the term non-terminal symbol a lot? Here is where you define what you mean by it. The key to this chapter is to keep it very, very short. Whenever you can, don't reinvent a description for an established concept, but reference a text book or paper instead.
    
\emph{Tip}: Do not spend too much time on your background and opening remarks before you have started with the main text.

\subsection{Defining the scope of your thesis}
One of the first tasks of a researcher is defining the scope of a study, i.e. its area (theme, field) and the amount of information to be included. Narrowing the scope of your thesis can be time-consuming, but the more you limit the scope, the more interesting a thesis becomes and the easier it will be for you to decide what is relevant to include and what can be excluded. This is because a narrower scope lets you clarify the problem and study it at greater depth, whereas very broad research questions only allow a superficial treatment.

Sometimes you can also clarify the scope by providing an overall research question or a hypothesis that will be tested. More specific sub-questions~/~hypotheses should be formulated and motivated in the \nameref{chp:method} chapter.
    
\subsection{Outline}
The outline gives an overview of the main points of your thesis. It clarifies the structure of your thesis and helps you find the correct focus for your work. The outline can also be used in supervision sessions, especially in the beginning. You might find that you need to restructure your thesis. Working on your outline can then be a good way of making sense of the necessary changes. A good outline shows how the different parts relate to each other, and is a useful guide for the reader.
