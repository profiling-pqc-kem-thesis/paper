% General topic overview - simplified
People worldwide use the Internet every day for a myriad of things. We shop for food, clothes and services, communicate with family and friends and entertain ourselves using streaming services. Businesses and enterprises rely on the Internet not only to serve their ever-growing customer base, but also transmit confidential information, personal identifiable information, credit card transactions and more. That the Internet traffic is kept secure for people and businesses alike is imperative. Public-key cryptography is a fundamental technology in providing this security \cite{rfc8446}. Used heavily in the \gls{tls} protocol, \glspl{vpn} and other applications, public-key cryptography serves the purpose of ensuring that a party is who they say they are and that encryption keys may be exchanged on insecure channels without ever jeopardizing the confidentiality of the traffic \cite{rfc8446}. For now, it is believed that the algorithms in use will continue to be secure from attacks by conventional computers for the foreseeable future. The rise of a new type of computer and set of algorithms, the quantum computer and quantum algorithms, have shown that the fundamental security of today's cryptography is threatened and is likely to be made obsolete in the near future\todo{Insert outlook by Microsoft and IBM / roadmap and some numbers?}.

% General, more in-depth, introduce NIST
Today, many protocols use public-key cryptography to exchange a key between two parties. The recommended public-key cryptography suites are based on one of the following problems being hard to solve; integer factorization and elliptic-curve discrete logarithm\cite{nsa2015, nist2019}. One of the most prominent threats to the encryption algorithms is Shor's algorithm\cite{shor1997}. The algorithm has been found to be able to solve the previously mentioned problems. However, it is known to be difficult or impractical to run on a traditional computer, but easy to run efficiently for a quantum computer. Today's quantum computers are not powerful enough to execute Shor's algorithm on the large numbers that are used in modern cryptography. As quantum computers get more powerful and available to more people, the threat increases.

The transition to a new set of algorithms that are not built on the same underlying mathematics is becoming increasingly important. These algorithms, called \gls{post-quantum} algorithms, have not yet been standardized. The \acrfull{nist} has started their standardization process with an open call for submissions of \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem} and digital signature algorithms. The process has, at the time of writing, gone through three rounds of submissions - with algorithmic changes and performance optimizations made each iteration. During this standardization process, the security and performance of the submissions are researched for various use cases and in various environments. We have identified a gap in research when it comes to study the performance of these \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem} on mainframe hardware.

% Introduce mainframes and connect to introduction of cryptography
The mainframe computer is a uniquely engineered computer that is designed to handle a large amount of data and bulk transactions \cite{mainframes}. Their availability, resilience, high throughput and security are core features \cite{mainframes}. Although they might not be used directly by most people, mainframes are used all around the world to process millions of hotel bookings daily as well as 90\% of airline reservations and 90\% of credit card transactions made every day \cite{jacobi2020}. The fact that personal information, trade secrets and more are kept secure when transferring them for processing and storage is critical. The use of these modern cryptography algorithms make mainframes susceptible to the issues imposed by the progress of quantum computing and the the use of Shor's algorithm. Due to the vast use of mainframes and their reliance on strong public-key cryptography, it is central to our society that the move to \gls{post-quantum} cryptography can be performed without sacrificing the availability, resilience, high throughput or security of the mainframes.

% Describe the specific problem you will address
We have investigated if the transition to \gls{post-quantum} cryptography can be made in the near future, in terms of performance of \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem} on consumer, cloud and mainframe hardware. With a study of the performance of \gls{post-quantum} algorithms on various architectures we provide up-to-date data to shed light on the readiness of hardware for the \gls{post-quantum} transition. This data may be used by individuals and business alike to understand how the transition may impact them. We also identify what specialized features of a mainframe computer can be utilized to increase the performance of \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem}. Our research questions are the following.


\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{RQ1} Does the performance of \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem} differ between architectures and if so, how?\label{rq1}
    
    \item \textbf{RQ2} What specialized instructions and features applicable for \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem} are available in \gls{z15}?\label{rq2}\todo{z15 has not yet been introduced. Introduce in mainframe part of introduction?}
    
    \item \textbf{RQ3} What techniques may be used to increase the performance of \gls{post-quantum} \glspl{kem}?\label{rq3}
